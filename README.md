# Music-Duplicate-Finder
This is a basic duplicate finder for selections in Apple's Music Program. It is written in Applescript.

It first takes the selection from Music and adds it to a list that the program can parse easier. It runs through that list and if it finds an already used artist, it adds it to the list of duplicates. 

If it's not there, you're good to go and it then adds it to the end of the artist list.

If the duplicate list is empty, it returns a "good job" message. If it isn't, then it lists the duplicate artists.

Simple stuff.
